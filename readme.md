Arduino
========

* Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free.

* For more information, see the website at: http://www.arduino.cc/
or the forums at: http://arduino.cc/forum/

* To report a *bug* in this programming please do maile me i will try my best to figure it out  to:
yubarajpoudel708@gmail.com

* More complex requests and technical discussion should go on the Arduino Developers
mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!forum/developers

* If you're interested in modifying or extending the Arduino software, I  strongly 
suggest discussing your ideas on the Developers mailing list *before* starting
to work on them. That way you can coordinate with the Arduino Team and others,
giving your work a higher ichance of being integrated into the official release
